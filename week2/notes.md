## Realism

### Technological realism
- Doesn't care about context, technology has politics and have inherent power

### Contextual realism
- Takes context into consideration. For example, bridges aren't inherently discriminatory but the parkway bridges
that restricted access to Long Island were designed in such a way as to enforce discrimnation. 



## Social Constructivism
- Social representations fully determine constitution of agency (action) in which particular social representations of artifacts
allow for agency (whether an artificat is politcal or not is rooted in social construts)


## Hybrid Constructivism
- Any relevant elements referred to in an analysis should be assigned a similar explanatory role and should be analyzed by the 
same type of vocabulary
- Phenomena occur as a result of the activity of a heterogenous network of entities that work to co-construct it.


## Differentiated Constructivism
- The agency of artificats results partly from the material design structure of artificats and partly from social processes.
- The separation between social and physical actants is one that is imperative to the analysis.
